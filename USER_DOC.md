# User Documentation

## Services

This project is a **static website** — there are no backend services, databases, or server processes. The stack exposes a single service:

| Service | Description | URL |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Portfolio website | Static HTML/CSS resume page (bilingual) | Hosted via GitHub Pages |

The site is served entirely from pre-built static files. Once deployed to a hosting provider, no runtime processes need management.

## Start, Stop, and Restart

### Local Development Server

```bash
# Start
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:4321

# Stop
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the dev server.

# Restart
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then run npm run dev again.
```

### Production Preview (local)

```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Start preview server
npm run preview
# → http://localhost:4321

# Stop
# Press Ctrl+C
```

### Production (deployed)

The production site is hosted via GitHub Pages as static files. There is no process to start, stop, or restart — GitHub Pages serves the `dist/` directory automatically after deployment. To update the live site, push changes to the repository and trigger a rebuild (or redeploy the `dist/` folder manually).

## Accessing Interfaces

| Interface | URL | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Portuguese version (default) | `http://localhost:4321/` (dev) | Default locale, no prefix |
| English version | `http://localhost:4321/en/` (dev) | English locale at `/en/` |
| Sitemap | `<github-pages-url>/sitemap-index.xml` (prod) | Auto-generated by `@astrojs/sitemap` |
| Robots.txt | `<github-pages-url>/robots.txt` (prod) | Static file in `public/` |

There is no admin panel, API, or authenticated area. All content is edited in source code and deployed statically.

## Credentials

This project has **no credentials, secrets, or environment variables**. There is no `.env` file required. The `.gitignore` includes `.env` entries as a safeguard, but the application does not read any environment variables at runtime.

All content (name, email, links) is hardcoded in `src/i18n/translations.ts`.

## Health Checks and Verification

### Verify the build succeeds

```bash
npm run build
```

A successful build exits with code 0 and produces output in `dist/`. Verify key files exist:

```bash
ls dist/index.html dist/en/index.html dist/sitemap-index.xml dist/robots.txt
```

### Verify the site renders correctly

```bash
npm run preview
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321` in a browser and confirm:

- [ ] Page loads without errors (check browser console)
- [ ] Name, role, contact information displayed correctly
- [ ] Language switcher toggles between Portuguese and English
- [ ] All sections render: Summary, Skills, Experience, Education
- [ ] Print view is clean (Ctrl+P or `@media print` in DevTools)
- [ ] Mobile layout is responsive (resize to < 640px)

### Verify SEO and metadata

In the browser, inspect the `<head>` element and confirm:

- `<title>` tag matches the locale
- Open Graph `og:image` points to `/og-image.png`
- `<link rel="canonical">` is set
- `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` tags exist for both locales
- JSON-LD script tag contains valid `Person` schema

### Verify the deployed site

```bash
curl -sI <your-github-pages-url> | head -5
```

A 200 status confirms the site is live. The sitemap can be verified at `<your-github-pages-url>/sitemap-index.xml`.
